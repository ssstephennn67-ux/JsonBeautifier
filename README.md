## 🚀 Why This Tool?

Standard beautifiers only fix indentation. When you're drowning in a 5,000-line API response, you need **organization** and **focus**. This tool was built to solve the "data noise" problem.

### 🔥 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⚡ Recursive Sorting** | Deep-cleans your JSON. Every nested object key is sorted alphabetically (A-Z). |
| **🎯 Array Filtering** | Select only the keys you care about (e.g., `id`, `email`) in large arrays to hide the noise. |
| **📂 Smart Navigation** | One-click to "Collapse Children" or "Expand All" with dynamic item count summaries. |
| **🎨 Premium Themes** | One Dark, Monokai Pro, Nord, and more. Optimized for long coding sessions. |
| **🌐 Multi-Language** | Full support for **English** and **Traditional Chinese**. |

## 🤖 Built with Cursor AI

This project was developed using **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)**, the AI-powered code editor. By leveraging AI-assisted pair programming, I was able to rapidly implement:
1. **Complex Recursion Logic**: Ensuring deep sorting and filtering without performance bottlenecks.
2. **Contextual State Management**: A filtering system that remembers your preferences for each specific array.
3. **Responsive UX**: Fluid layout transitions and theme engine.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

* **100% Client-Side**: All parsing and beautification happen directly in your browser. **Your data never leaves your machine.**
* **Zero Tracking**: No cookies, no analytics, no logs. Pure utility.
* **Transparent Hosting**: Hosted on GitHub Pages—the code is open and verifiable.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Paste** your raw JSON into the input panel.
2. **Parse** to generate the interactive, color-coded tree.
3. **Filter** large arrays by clicking the <kbd>Filter</kbd> icon next to them.
