## 🚀 Why "Beyond Beautification"?

Most online JSON tools are "dumb" — they just add spaces and indents. Even worse, many send your sensitive data to their servers for processing. 

**Smart JSON Studio** is built for developers who care about **Privacy** and **Context**. Everything is processed **locally in your browser**. Your data never leaves your machine.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🔒 Privacy-First Design**: Zero server-side processing. Safe for API keys, user data, and internal configurations.
* **🧠 Smart Context Recognition**: Automatically detects and formats specific data types:
    * **Timestamp Conversion**: Instantly turns Unix timestamps into human-readable dates.
    * **Color Preview**: Visualizes Hex/RGB color codes.
    * **Nested Parsing**: Cleanly handles stringified JSON within JSON.
* **🔍 Power Search & Filter**: Find what you need in massive JSON files instantly.
* **🎨 Developer UI**: Clean interface with syntax highlighting and a "Copy to Clipboard" that actually works.

## 📖 The Philosophy

This tool was created to solve the "Privacy vs. Convenience" dilemma. You shouldn't have to risk leaking sensitive data just to get a readable JSON tree.
